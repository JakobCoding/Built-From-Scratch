### 📦 Pseudocode — With UI Structure in Mind

Let’s refine the pseudocode with a focus on what elements we’ll need in HTML:

1. An **input** to enter the amount.
2. A **select dropdown** to choose the **base currency**.
3. A **select dropdown** to choose the **target currency**.
4. A **button** to trigger the conversion.
5. A **display area** to show the result.

### 🧱 Tips for HTML Structure

Use **semantic HTML** and keep it modular and logical. Here's how you could break it down mentally:

- A `<main>` container to hold everything.
- Inside that:

  - A `<form>` or just a `<div>` block with:
    - Input for amount.
    - Select for source currency.
    - Select for target currency.
    - Convert button.
  - A `<div>` or `<p>` to show the result.

### 🏗️ Suggestion for Building Blocks (no code, just structure):

Here’s what to _think_ in your head as you're typing:

- “Okay, I need a container to hold the whole converter.”
- “Now I need an input where the user types the amount.”
- “Then two dropdowns — one for base currency, one for target currency.”
- “And a button to run the conversion.”
- “Finally, somewhere for the result to be shown.”
